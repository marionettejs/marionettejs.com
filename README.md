## Setup

To prep your repo, all you need to do is run our `setup` script.

    npm run setup

After that, development should be easy! Use our `dev` task to get everything up and running:

    npm run dev

Then visit [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).

## Compiling the docs

Working on the docs is just as easy as working on the website. Run the `dev` task as mentioned above but make sure you also compile the docs:

    npm run dev
    npm run compile-docs

You'll need to rerun this command after template changes.

## When adding SVG

Follow [these steps](./svg-steps.md)
