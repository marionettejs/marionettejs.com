# Build with Marionette

Use the application's installed contract and preserve compatible integration
choices. This skill does not authorize dependency upgrades.

## Locate matching docs

Resolve the package from the application workspace, not the copied skill directory
or a neighboring monorepo package. The read-only helper requires Node 24 or later.
Its path is `scripts/docs.mjs` relative to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`:

- In the npm package, that directory is `<package-root>/dist/agent-skill/`.
- After copying the skill, it is the copied directory, such as
  `/path/to/application/.agents/skills/marionette/`.

Replace `/path/to/skill-directory` with that directory's absolute path and
`/path/to/application` with the application's absolute path. These commands work
from any working directory:

```sh
node "/path/to/skill-directory/scripts/docs.mjs" --project "/path/to/application" --list
node "/path/to/skill-directory/scripts/docs.mjs" --project "/path/to/application" --page docs/agents.md
```

These are lookup options, not a required sequence. `--list` returns provenance and
available page paths; `--page` reads one source path. The helper checks packaged
documentation hashes and version without executing project code or using a network.
For installations without `node_modules`, supply `--package-root` with the physical
package directory obtained from that application's package manager.

If packaged docs are absent, use the exact release or known source commit and
installed exports/declarations. Do not silently substitute current website docs,
`master`, or another workspace's package. An alpha version alone does not establish
source identity; `sourceDirty: true` is not an immutable release. Documentation
hashes do not prove a custom runtime matches them; test uncertain runtime behavior.

## Select the relevant contract

Pass the task page's `source` field from the manifest or `--list` output to
`--page`; it prints provenance followed by the page content. Only `--list` returns
each page's absolute `path`, for reading the file directly:

| Task | Packaged page |
| --- | --- |
| New application | `docs/development.md` for the typed starter; `docs/choosing-integrations.md` for integration decisions |
| Migrating an existing application | `docs/agent-tools.md` (pre-migration setup); `docs/migration-from-v4.md` and `upgradeGuide.md` from that target |
| Application architecture or unfamiliar ownership | `docs/agents.md` |
| Rendering or screen replacement | `docs/marionette.view.md`, `docs/marionette.region.md`, `docs/view.lifecycle.md` |
| Changing lists or observable records | `docs/marionette.collectionview.md`, `docs/data.api.md` |
| Application runs, readiness, or late save completion | `docs/marionette.application.md`, `docs/application-effects.md`; request replacement: `docs/application-refresh.md` |
| Navigation | `docs/routing.md` |
| Hover, nested clicks, or DOM preservation | `docs/dom.interactions.md`, `docs/view.rendering.md` |
| State ownership or framework error | `docs/marionette.state.md` or `docs/diagnostic-catalog.md` |
| Skill setup or optional documentation MCP | `docs/agent-tools.md` |

Follow relevant links rather than loading an overview and every reference. For MCP,
read the retrieval rules in `docs/agent-tools.md` before remote use: exact version
and source must match. Installed Markdown remains sufficient. For v4 applications,
use matching migration material and installed APIs; this skill is not an upgrade plan.

DataApi, StateApi, renderer, DomApi, EventDelegator, and router are independent
choices; a Backbone router does not require Backbone data. Register configuration
before consumers. Use templates, named Regions, and public lifecycle APIs; domain
records belong in data sources, not child View traversal. For application design,
including personalized examples, use `docs/agents.md`.

## Completion

The requested application behavior works against the installed package, preserves
unrelated edits/focus and ownership, and has evidence for the affected interaction
and cleanup boundary. Reproduce uncertain contracts through public package APIs.
Use the application's checks; exercise actual clicks, focus, hover boundaries,
replacement and cleanup with the selected adapters. Browser interactions require
browser evidence. Report actual results and untested boundaries. Record changed
integration decisions in the application's notes, keeping API details in the docs.
