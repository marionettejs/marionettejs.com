# Testing Marionette

Tests protect public contracts. Source folders describe implementation; test
folders describe the behavior a consumer can rely on. New tests should use a
shallow contract-oriented suite and explicit imports, fixtures, and cleanup.
Do not move a regression merely to match an internal refactor.

## Stay within the supported lifecycle

Use the [synchronous failure contract](../docs/view.lifecycle.md#synchronous-failures)
as the boundary for runtime tests. Valid adapters must return working cleanup
callbacks. Synchronous registration, construction, render, and teardown exceptions
abort the operation; do not write tests promising rollback, remaining cleanup after
a throw, usable partial instances, or recovery on the next notification.

Public API access is necessary but does not by itself make a scenario supported.
Retention checks and mutation survivors must not drive new per-instance recovery
bookkeeping or guards around unsupported mutation during a callback. Present a real
consumer case and the complexity/performance tradeoff for an explicit maintainer
decision before expanding the contract. Keep coverage for successful subscription
release, ordinary ownership/idempotence, and documented asynchronous Application
readiness, cancellation, and restart. Reviewer prompts must carry this distinction.

## Choose the smallest useful check

| Contract | Location | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public runtime behavior | `unit/` | `npm test -- test/unit/region-lifecycle.spec.js` |
| Pure events, Radio, utilities and data | Vitest Node project | `npm test -- --project=node` |
| DOM and lifecycle behavior | Vitest DOM project | `npm test -- --project=dom` |
| Real focus, events, DOM adapters and package behavior | `browser/` | `npm run test:browser -- --project=chromium -g 'focus'` |
| ESM and CommonJS declaration consumers | `types/` | `npm run build && npm run test:types` |
| Installed ESM/CJS/Vite/TypeScript and executable docs | `fixtures/` | `npm run test:fixtures -- --fixture esm-node` |
| CLI, release, docs, performance and benchmark infrastructure | `tooling/`, `release/`, `docs/`, `performance/`, `agent-benchmark/` | `npm run test:tooling` |
| Static production import graph | `source/` | `npm run test:source` |
| Built ESM/CJS/UMD exports | `dist/` | `npm run test:dist` |

`npm ci` uses the pinned toolchain and builds packages through `prepare`. `npm test`
is deliberately fast: it runs unit tests without a hidden type/build pretest.
After source edits, rebuild before directly invoking consumer types, browser or
distribution checks. `npm run verify` rebuilds and checks lint/types/unit contracts;
Verification runs each step to completion; CI job time limits bound CI runs.
`npm run verify -- --full` adds both coverage reports, source/distribution checks,
real browsers, documentation checks, and every installed fixture.
`--full` also warms the pinned agent environment and runs the reference app plus
positive/negative corpus controls. They can be invoked separately with
`agent:cache`, `test:agent-app`, `agent:reference`, and `agent:fixtures`. These
commands never invoke a model.

`npm run lint` never edits files. Use `npm run lint:fix` explicitly. Lint rejects
focused/disabled unit tests, missing assertions, unawaited async assertions, and
floating promises in tooling. `npm run check:public-tests` rejects private members,
private overrides and internal source imports in runtime tests and helpers; review
must still catch indirect private access that static syntax cannot identify.
`npm run check:workflows` rejects duplicate YAML keys and runs SHA-256-pinned
actionlint. Its first run downloads a verified archive into `test/tmp/tools/`;
subsequent runs reuse and verify that archive. ShellCheck and Pyflakes are not
implicitly discovered from a developer's PATH.

## Repeat and diagnose

Use `npm test -- <file> -t '<test name>'` for one contract, or `npm run test:watch`.
For order failures, record and replay the seed:

```sh
npm test -- --sequence.shuffle --sequence.seed=20260908
```

Unit CI emits `test/tmp/unit-results.xml`. Playwright emits JSON and JUnit results,
HTML reports, failure screenshots and traces under `test/tmp/browser/`; retries
are disabled so flakes remain visible. Run `npx playwright show-report
test/tmp/browser/report` or open an individual retained trace. Browser tests use
Chromium, Firefox and WebKit from the checked-in release profile.

## CI jobs

The Node 24 CI suites run in parallel: core checks and unit coverage, tooling
coverage, browser contracts, agent reference controls, and Linux package fixtures.
Each job installs and builds its own checkout and uploads its own reports. The
`Node 24` aggregate check succeeds only when all five suites succeed; a failed,
cancelled, or skipped suite does not pass the aggregate check. macOS package smoke
runs alongside these jobs, and Windows package smoke runs on master pushes.

Each suite uploads the following repository report paths:

| Artifact | Uploaded paths |
| --- | --- |
| `coverage-node-24` | `coverage/`, `test/tmp/unit-results.xml` |
| `tooling-node-24` | `coverage/tooling/` |
| `browsers-node-24` | `test/tmp/browser/results.json`, `test/tmp/browser/results.xml`, `test/tmp/browser/report/`, `test/tmp/browser/results/`, `test/tmp/performance/browser-report.json` |
| `agent-reference-node-24` | `test/tmp/agent-reference-app/`, `test/tmp/agent-reference/reference-report.json`, `test/tmp/agent-reference/artifacts/artifact-input.json`, `test/tmp/agent-fixtures/fixture-controls.json` |
| `fixtures-node-24` | `test/tmp/fixture-reports/` |

Release promotion runs its separate exact-artifact validation when triggered;
its elapsed time is independent of the regular CI suites.

## Coverage means observable execution

`npm run coverage` reports library coverage at `coverage/library/index.html`, with
LCOV and JSON summaries alongside it. Every authored production file is included,
including unexecuted files. Functions remain at 100%. Each file defaults to 100% for
all metrics; `config/coverage-exceptions.json` records the few private defensive
branches that valid public operations cannot reach. Limits are absolute uncovered
counts per file and globally, so adding code cannot dilute them. Ratchet a limit
down when public tests cover it; any increase needs an explicit reviewed reason.
Do not hide uncovered code with ignores or test manufactured private states.

`npm run coverage:tooling` separately reports every script/build module, including
zero-coverage files, at `coverage/tooling/index.html`. It captures subprocess CLI
execution as well as in-process tests. This report must not inflate the library
percentage. Review release failure/recovery tests together with the percentage;
a high count of mocked decisions alone does not prove the command works. The release
CLI subset has separate minimums of 90% lines/statements, 70% branches, and 100%
functions in `config/release-coverage.json`; all other tooling remains visible in
the report, including unexecuted files.

## Public operation models

`npm run check:api-contracts` verifies the source-derived public inventory and its
explicit semantic/evidence mappings. It runs in normal verification, CI and packed
candidate validation. Regeneration requires reviewing the changed public contract;
see `scripts/api-contracts/README.md`. It does not replace behavioral tests.

`npm run test:model` replays deterministic consumer-owned lifecycle models; these
also run in the normal unit suite. `npm run test:mutation` measures a bounded
ownership/subscription subset with two workers and a ten-minute deadline. The
manual Mutation workflow retains complete and partial reports. See
[model replay and measured survivors](unit/model-based/README.md).

`npm run test:mutation -- --profile release` selects only release authorization,
channel selection and immutable npm recovery decisions. It uses Node's test runner
through Stryker's command runner with the same two-worker, ten-minute bound and
retained source/test/lock hashes. It does not contact npm or GitHub. The separate
end-to-end release CLI fixtures remain required; this pilot is not evidence for
every publication failure path. Neither profile enforces a mutation score.
The empty `scripts/.babelrc` keeps native Node tooling outside the library's Babel
build presets, including when Stryker parses release scripts with its own Babel.

## Locked consumer fixtures

Each fixture commits its external dependency lock. The runner copies each consumer
into a unique OS temporary directory outside the checkout, overlays the five exact
candidate packages, verifies the external dependency graph is unchanged, and uses
`npm ci`. It strips inherited checkout tool paths and `NODE_PATH`. Concurrent
attempts own independent install/output/cleanup directories.

Without artifact inputs, the runner builds and packs once. To validate a candidate:

```sh
npm run test:fixtures -- --artifact-dir release --report test/tmp/fixtures.json
```

Release hosts may divide the complete inventory deterministically with
`--shard-index <one-based-index> --shard-total <count>`. Supply both options, do not
combine them with `--fixture`, and require every shard so their union preserves the
full fixture contract.

All five explicit tarball flags are also accepted together. Partial/mixed inputs
fail before installation. Reports include artifact and lock hashes, installed
graphs, output, stage, status and elapsed time for every attempted fixture.
To intentionally refresh one external graph, use `npm --prefix
test/fixtures/<name> update --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`, review its
manifest and lock together, then run that fixture. Never delete locks during tests.

## Exact release candidates

From a clean committed checkout:

```sh
npm run release:artifact -- --output release
npm run release:validate -- --artifact-dir release
npm run release:verify -- --artifact-dir release --require-validation
```

`config/release-validation.json` declares the required browser file/title identities
and installed-consumer fixtures. Update this inventory when intentionally changing
the release test surface. Certification requires every declared browser case in
every engine from the release profile, plus every fixture; a reduced passing report
cannot silently reduce the release requirements.


Candidate validation runs required checks and tests browser/distribution/fixture
consumers against the original tarballs. Its separate validation record binds logs,
three-engine browser results, fixture results and lock hashes to the immutable
release evidence. Failed/incomplete/mismatched evidence cannot be promoted.
`config/release-promotion.json` separately authorizes stable publication and one
exact prerelease version. Stable publication remains disabled; beta.3 is the
currently authorized prerelease. Validation never grants publication permission.

## Dependency maintenance

Update related test runner and coverage-provider pins together, with their lockfile
and actual suite validation. Root development dependencies never belong in a
published runtime graph. The narrow Stryker override of `typed-rest-client`'s `qs`
pin selects 6.16.0 to avoid its reported denial-of-service advisories; remove that
override when Stryker's dependency chain accepts a fixed version natively. Every
mutation/benchmark run remains development tooling with explicit scope and limits.

Dependabot proposes weekly root tooling and pinned GitHub Action updates, with
Vitest and Stryker packages grouped by tool. Monthly consumer-fixture updates
preserve review of their independent lockfiles. Local Marionette package versions
are excluded from these automated updates. The bot never merges changes; browser
profile pins and all affected consumer contracts must still pass review and CI.
Configuration follows GitHub's [Dependabot options reference](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference).
