# Source and release profile

Marionette keeps its contributor and release toolchain reproducible without narrowing
the runtime contract for package consumers. The machine-readable authority is
[`config/release-profile.json`](../config/release-profile.json).

The current source profile uses Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.17.0. `.nvmrc`, the
`packageManager` declaration, CI, and `npm run check:release-profile` must agree with
that file. The public package continues to support the Node range declared in
`engines`; the exact source profile identifies the environment used to build and
verify a release.

## Contributor setup

With `nvm` installed:

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
npm run check:release-profile
npm ci
npm run check:browser-profile
```

The Node release pinned here includes the pinned npm version. If another version of
npm is earlier on your path, select npm 11.17.0 before installing dependencies.

npm 11.17 records reviewed dependency installers in each package's top-level
`allowScripts` map. The repository enables `strict-allow-scripts` in `.npmrc`, so
installing a package whose scripts have not been reviewed fails instead of silently
executing them. Use `npm approve-scripts --allow-scripts-pending` to inspect pending
packages, review the exact package and version, and then use
`npm approve-scripts <package>` to add a version-pinned approval. Isolated fixture
packages keep their own approvals.

PR CI runs the complete suite on the canonical Ubuntu 24.04 x64 host and clean
installation and packed-package fixtures on macOS 15 arm64. The full Windows 2025
x64 package-fixture suite runs after merge on pushes to `master`, and remains a
required gate for release artifacts. Windows failures therefore surface after
merge without delaying routine PRs. Release dry runs on PRs test macOS; manually
dispatched release validation tests both macOS and Windows against the exact
candidate tarballs before publication.

GitHub's fixed OS labels still receive runner-image updates, so release evidence
records the actual image reported by each run. Hosted-runner timings remain
informative rather than hard performance gates.

## Browser profiles

Browser behavior and transpilation use separate pinned profiles. The
real-browser contract lane uses `@playwright/test` 1.63.0 with Chromium
153.0.8010.12 revision 1243, Firefox 155.0 revision 1543, and WebKit 26.6 revision
2359. These are the builds published for the [Playwright 1.63
release](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-163). Playwright WebKit is
the compatibility engine; it is not evidence that branded Safari ran in CI.

`npm run test:browser` runs named Playwright projects for all three engines. CI
installs their pinned binaries and retains results, reports, and failure traces.
Release validation supplies the exact candidate tarballs to this same suite.
A local `npm ci` installs the dependency but does not download browser binaries;
install them with Playwright before running browser checks locally.
`npm run check:browser-profile` compares the installed Playwright manifest with
`config/release-profile.json`.

The package and release profile use the semantic Browserslist query `baseline widely
available`. This is the minimum capability floor for transpilation, not a fixed list
of supported browser versions or an upper limit on newer releases. The browser-profile
check requires that exact query and verifies that it resolves successfully.

The checked-in lockfile fixes the Browserslist data used by each commit, so clean
installs reproduce that commit's resolved targets and build artifacts. Reviewed
lockfile updates may advance the resolved target list without changing the public
support contract. Resolved versions are build evidence, not manually maintained
browser-support ceilings.

## Advancing the profile

Profile changes use a dedicated pull request that updates every pin together and
passes the PR checks before merge. Post-merge Windows validation and complete
release-artifact validation must pass before the new profile is released.

- Review Node and npm patches monthly. Allow a seven-day upstream soak unless a
  security fix requires immediate adoption.
- Exercise a new Node major as a nonblocking lane while it is Current. Make it
  blocking only after it becomes LTS and completes a 30-day project soak. Raising
  Marionette's minimum supported Node major is a separate major-release decision.
- Introduce a replacement host image in parallel before making it canonical. Never
  use a moving `*-latest` label for release evidence.
- Review Playwright browser builds and Browserslist data monthly. Update the
  dependency, lockfile, and browser-build manifest in one reviewed pull request;
  changing the semantic transpilation query is a separate support-policy decision,
  and browser tests remain a separate contract lane.
- Freeze the profile for a release candidate. An emergency profile change reruns all
  release evidence.

Documentation publication is defined separately and must not silently change the
source, host, or browser pins.

Package publication uses the separate
[immutable release-promotion contract](release-promotion.md). That workflow records
this profile's Git blob revision and SHA-512 in the verified artifact. Changing the
profile after a candidate is built requires rebuilding and rerunning the complete
release evidence; publication jobs reject an artifact whose recorded profile differs
from the checked-out source commit.
