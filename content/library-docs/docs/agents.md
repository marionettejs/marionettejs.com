# Build with Marionette

Use this guide when an agent is building or maintaining an application with
Marionette. It links each decision to the same contracts a human reviewer uses.
For changes to Marionette itself, use the [maintainer guide](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette/blob/master/docs/maintainers/readme.md).

## Establish the installed contract

Use the application's manifest, lockfile, and configuration to establish the
contract when it is not already known. Relevant facts are:

- the installed `marionette` version and matching optional package versions;
- whether the dependency comes from a published package, Git commit, or local build;
- the source revision for a checkout or custom artifact;
- the selected renderer, data/state sources, DOM integrations, and router.

This documentation describes the current source. A local build with the same
version string may contain different code. A website example, a copied prompt, or a
third-party search result is not proof that the installed package has that API.
Match the documentation's source revision to the artifact when available, then
check the installed exports and declarations. Reproduce uncertain behavior with
a small test against that package.

For a fresh application, follow [installation](./installation.md). For a v4
application, use the [migration guide](./migration-from-v4.md) and
[upgrade guide](../upgradeGuide.md) before applying current patterns. Do not
silently upgrade dependencies to make an example fit.

## Read for the task

Use the task table directly. The [compact framework reference](./compact-reference.md)
provides an overview when the task spans unfamiliar contracts; it is not a
prerequisite for reading a specific guide.

| Task | Start here | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Show or update a piece of UI | [View](./marionette.view.md), [rendering](./view.rendering.md) | The intended element and content change; relevant handlers still work after rendering. |
| Replace part of a screen | [Region](./marionette.region.md), [View lifecycle](./view.lifecycle.md) | The outgoing View is cleaned up and the new View owns the intended mount. |
| Render a changing list | [CollectionView](./marionette.collectionview.md), [DataApi](./data.api.md) | Stable item identity, correct ordering, removal cleanup, and preservation of surviving edits. |
| Coordinate a feature or navigate | [Application](./marionette.application.md), [routing](./routing.md) | Startup success, stale navigation, failure, stop, and destruction. |
| Choose data, state, rendering, or DOM integration | [Choosing integrations](./choosing-integrations.md) | The chosen capability matches the source; configuring one integration does not implicitly configure another. |
| Host a screen in Vue, React, or another shell | [Host a Marionette screen](./hosting-views.md) | Managed attachment, one DOM owner, stable drafts, and cleanup before host removal. |
| Add local or shared state | [State sources](./marionette.state.md) | The correct observer updates; destroying one borrower does not dispose shared state. |
| Handle DOM or component events | [DOM interactions](./dom.interactions.md), [events](./events.md) | One intended response per interaction and no response after teardown. |
| Diagnose a framework error | [Diagnostic catalog](./diagnostic-catalog.md) | The invariant associated with the diagnostic code; do not match only error-message text. |

Read the relevant page and its direct references. Load the full documentation only
when the task requires a broader API review.

## Choose the smallest supported pattern

Keep the application's established integrations unless the task requires changing
them. For new code, start with the built-in defaults: native DOM APIs, function
templates, and plain objects or arrays. Plain sources are not observable; update
the UI explicitly or select an observable integration when the task needs one.

Choose data, state, rendering, and DOM capabilities independently. Follow the
[integration decision order](./choosing-integrations.md) before writing a custom
adapter. Record the chosen provider and its registration point once in the
application's own architecture notes so later agents do not choose again.

Use a View for interface ownership, a Region for placement, and a CollectionView
for repeated children. Use an Application when work has an asynchronous feature
lifecycle. A plain function or class is enough when it needs none of these
contracts. The [class guide](./classes.md) explains the boundaries.

Before expanding a small example into an application, revisit its data and ownership
choices. A recipe demonstrating manually managed children is not a default data
architecture for a todo application. Domain records belong in a data source;
CollectionView children are their presentation. Do not use child View traversal as
the application's record store. Plain arrays can remain appropriate for explicit
snapshot updates. When records need shared observation, filtering, and coordinated
updates, select an observable provider; for a new application without one, start
with `@mnjs/data` and its [DataApi setup](./data.api.md). Native Collection
`toArray()` returns plain attributes; iteration yields Models. Do not assume
Backbone/Underscore methods.

Native DOM defaults describe the integration, not a replacement for View composition.
Render ordinary content through `template` and `templateContext`, place child Views
through named Regions, and declare controls with `ui`, `events`, and `triggers`.
Use `events` when the handler needs input or keyboard details; use `triggers` when
an interaction should become a View event. Direct DOM work still belongs at real
integration boundaries, such as focus, measurements, and an external animation or
widget. Keep its lifetime with the owning View.

Observe each field used by a template or derived display, including changes that
do not come from its main button. Let CollectionView handle membership changes
without a second whole-list render subscription. Keep focused editors stable
when processing their own input.

When building teaching examples, make the application runnable independently of
narration and inspection. Prefer ordinary modules with explicit imports and exports.
Check that the preview supports the selected packages and module structure; a tiny
sandbox's restrictions should not silently become the recommended app architecture.

For personalized applications, connect a real user preference to interaction and
visual design. Preserve readable hierarchy, spacing, contrast, labels, and narrow
layouts; inspect the rendered result at desktop and narrow widths when changing
visuals. Do not collapse independent owners to meet a line count or include
teaching/test controls in the app. The website's optional personal-app brief supplies
its own starter; it does not authorize browsing private sources for personalization.

Configure the selected runtime before creating its consumers. The default named
exports share a runtime. Use [runtime isolation](./runtime-isolation.md) when
independent configurations must coexist; do not create a runtime per View.

## Make ownership and cancellation explicit

For each resource, name the owner and the operation that releases it. Let the
owning Region or CollectionView manage its child Views through public APIs.
Use [View lifecycle hooks](./view.lifecycle.md) for external listeners, timers,
and widgets according to their actual render, attachment, and destruction lifetime.
A rerender must not accumulate resources; destroying a View must not leave them
running.

A supplied `state` source is borrowed. A `createState()` result is owned and uses
the configured StateApi's optional disposal hook when its owner is destroyed.
Marionette does not infer ownership from which object first reads a source.

Await Application lifecycle operations when later work depends on their result.
They return `Promise<boolean>`: `true` means the target state was reached; `false`
means the request was superseded. A current readiness failure rejects. Keep those
outcomes distinct. Constructor hooks run synchronously, and completion hooks are synchronous
notifications; returning a Promise from them does not add readiness.

Pass the preparation method's signal to cancellable work. After an asynchronous step,
check that it still belongs to the active operation before committing application
side effects. Marionette suppresses stale lifecycle completion; it cannot undo an
arbitrary write made by application code. Follow the complete
[routing pattern](./routing.md) for navigation and feature startup.

Keep an Application's active lifetime separate from each data request. If list
results and a sidebar have separate owners under one shell, refresh the list's
collection in place and cancel superseded requests; restarting their parent
destroys both UI trees. See the [persistent-shell example](./application-refresh.md#keep-a-shell-and-independently-owned-children).

## Completion evidence

Use the application's existing test runner, scripts, and package manager. Library
maintenance commands are not a consumer project's test strategy.

The requested behavior is complete when its interaction and affected ownership
boundary work in the installed application. For an
asynchronous screen, navigate away while work is pending and ensure its stale
result cannot replace the current screen. For a list, edit a surviving row while
inserting, removing, or reordering another row. For a subscription, destroy one
consumer and confirm the remaining consumer still receives updates.

Use a real browser when correctness depends on focus, attachment, DOM event
propagation, or editable state. A build or screenshot alone does not prove those
interactions. Use documented public APIs for assertions rather than private
framework fields.

Review the architecture separately from interaction results: identify the data
source, the Views and Regions that own the screen, and the external work each owner
releases. Working buttons do not establish that the example teaches those contracts.
For observable data, change the source directly and verify all intended consumers
update. For attachment-bound resources, also detach and reattach the same View;
replacement alone does not prove that repeated attachment releases resources.

When reporting a change, name the behavior, the tested package/source, the exact
commands or interactions performed, and any untested boundary. Keep changes
focused and avoid introducing runtime instrumentation merely to help an agent
understand the code.

## Use agent tools as another way to read the same docs

Follow [Set up an agent](./agent-tools.md) to install the consumer skill and read
version-matched packaged docs. Adapt the [application instruction template](./application-agent-template.md)
to preserve this project's actual decisions across tasks.

For structured retrieval or service setup, use [the agent tools guide](./agent-tools.md).
It owns exact-version/source matching, MCP pagination, and offline retrieval rules.
Read those rules before using a remote service. No hosted service is required.
Website WebMCP controls its example; its results do not establish application behavior.

Application instructions should record local decisions and link to the relevant
contracts, not copy this guide or the library's maintainer policy.
